Just walked out of It Feeds and my brain is doing that weird sputtering thing where all the gears don't quite line up. I'm exhausted, though not sure if that's from the movie or just life doing its usual grind. You know when you feel like you've got a popcorn kernel stuck in your teeth, just bugging you? That's kind of how the movie felt, but in my brain.

First off, can we just talk about the sound? It's like someone asked: How much eerie screeching can we cram into two hours? Answer: a whole lot. I honestly thought at one point they had a cat playing the violin. But then, that's being generous to cats. It’s like the soundtrack was its own villain, hissing you're not safe the whole damn time. Weirdly charming, though? Is that a thing? Maybe I've finally snapped.

The story's all about hunger, right? Figurative, literal, emotional? But sometimes you're just like, dude, eat a sandwich and calm down. The monster's there too, hiding in the shadows like that weird uncle at a family reunion, not sure if you're supposed to feel scared or just concerned for its mental health.

> Okay, there's this bit where the monster—or is it the protagonist at that point? Honestly, the lines blur—leans in close to the camera, and you're drawn in like, “alright, what’s next?” But instead of something profound, it's more like discovering the center of a tootsie pop is just another wrapper.

Also, am I the only one who feels attacked by that ending? Like, emotionally-held-hostage kinda situation. They just leave you dangling there, probably cackling in their little director chairs. If directors even have chairs. And I sat there, dumbfounded, and thought is this some existential commentary or just lazy writing? Either way, I didn't hate it. Maybe that says more about me than the movie.

Fine, I admit, I’ll probably recommend my friends 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the movie—after sufficiently vague warnings about potential cranial popcorn-kernel aftermaths. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the movie, if only to feel smarter than you are, or maybe just to appreciate your own life's lack of monsters. Not counting the odd relative or two.

```js
let fearLevel = hunger  2;
if (fearLevel > sanity) {
    monster.reveal();
}
```

But seriously, I might be tired and probably a bit grumpy, but It Feeds stuck with me. Like an old tattoo, faded but still there, reminding me every time I catch a glimpse. So, here's to movies that bug the hell out of you and sneak their way into your psyche without permission. Bravo, annoying little bugger.
